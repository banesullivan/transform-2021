In these cases, all\nthat is needed to recover the grid is the dimensions of the grid\n(`nx` by `ny` by `nz`) and that the coordinates are ordered appropriately.\n\n\nFor this example, we will create a small dataset and rotate the\ncoordinates such that they are not on orthogonal to cartesian reference\nframe.\n\n"
